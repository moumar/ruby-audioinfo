Or install it yourself as:

## Usage

```
AudioInfo.open("audio_file.one_of_supported_extensions") do |info|
  info.artist   # or info["artist"]
  info.title    # or info["title"]
  info.length   # playing time of the file
  info.bitrate  # average bitrate
  info.to_h     # { "artist" => "artist", "title" => "title", etc... }
end
